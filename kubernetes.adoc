= Kubernetes

* equivalent to docker swarm and mesos
* open source orchestration for containers
** lets you schedule containers on a cluster of machines
** run multiple containers on one machine
** run long running services (like web applications)
* Kubernetes can manage state of the containers
** start/stop container on specific nodes
** automatically restarts when containers gets killed
** can move containers from one node to another
** can manage one node to thousands of nodes
* can run on premise, cloud and hybrid (premise & cloud)


* Docker containers runs on docker engine
* rkt (rocket) is an alternative for docker container



== Kubernetes setup
* K8s can run anywhere
* Using Volumes and External Load Balancers needs support on the cloud for kubernetes
* AWS and GCE(google cloud) support it


== minikube
* `minikube` to spin up local single machine kubernetes cluster
* minikube cannot spin up a production grade cluster, it supports only one cluster with no high availability
* minikube can be used for development
* works on windows, linux and macos
* needs virtualization machine

.minikube commands:
====
* go to github and download minikube
* then run `minikube start`
* it creates ~/.kube/config
* kubectl run hello-kube --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4 --port=8080
deployment.apps/hello-kube created

➜  ~ kubectl expose deployment hello-kube --type=NodePort
service/hello-kube exposed

➜  ~ kubectl get service hello-kube

NAME         TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
hello-kube   NodePort   10.99.68.197   <none>        8080:31110/TCP   14s
====

.kubectl commands:
====
* install kubectl `brew install kubernetes-cli`
* kubectl run
* kubectl expose
====

== docker client
* alternative to minikube
* run kubernetes in docker client
* change kubectl context
* run a cloud image like echo server
* create and expose the service

.k8s using docker client
====
* kubectl get nodes
* kubectl config get-context
* change context if necessary
* kubectl run and expose
====

== Production level kubernetes client
* kops / kubeadm
* kops is recommended for aws
* `kops` is a production grade cluster spinner for AWS

== Kubernetes on AWS
* kops (kubernetes operations)
* kops is used to manage, update , start kubernetes
* kube-up.sh is a deprecated tool for kubernetes management
* kops works only on mac/linux

====
* create a user in aws
* create a s3 bucket in the closest region to you
* create proper DNS mapping
* `kops create cluster --name=k8s.suru.gq --state=s3://k8s.suru.gq --zones=us-east-1a --node-count=2 --node-size=t2.micro --master-size=t2.micro --dns-zone=k8s.suru.gq`
* kops update
* now kops and kubectl are interconnected
* if there is certificate error delete the root certificate and add insecure-skip-tls-verify: true to the particular cluster in .kube/config
* kubectl get node
* kubectl run hello-minikube --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4 --port=8080
* kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort
* kubectl get services
* open inbound traffic on the nodes (EC2) in aws
* get the public ip of the node in EC2 and the port exposed and you should be able to get the the service through the ip and port
* kops delete cluster --name k8s.suru.gq
====

== Running Docker
.docker commands
====
* Install docker
* go into working dir
* create the dockerfile and the app
* `sudo docker build .`
* `sudo docker run -p 3000:3000 -it <machine build name>`
* docker build -t docker-login/docker-name
* docker push docker-login/docker-name
====

.things_to_remember
====
* run only one process per container
* do not make the container too large
* split if necessary
====

== Running docker on Kubernetes
* create a pod definition
* pod is an application running on kubernetes
* a pod can contain one or more tightly coupled containers
* apps can communicate to each other using port numbers

====
* create a yml file for kubernetes for pods
* check if a node is running with kubectl get node (example minikube)
* kubectl create -f <filename>.yml
* kubectl get pod
* kubectl describe pod <podname>
* kubectl port-forward <podname> 8081:3000
* kubectl expose pod <podname> --type=NodePort --name="service name"
* minikube service <service name> --url
* kubectl get service

* kubectl attach <podname>
* kubectl exec <podname> -- <bash command>
* kubectl get service
* kubectl describe <podname>
====

== Load Balancer service with docker and k8s
* use type LoadBalancer and kind: service
* create a cluster (kops/minikube)
* create a pod
* create a load balancer (service)
* update domain / subdomain (route 53)

== General Structure of kubernetes

* A service (like load balancer) -> ip tables -> nodes -> pods > containers
* Each pod can contain multiple containers
* Apps can use localhost and port within the same pod, but traffic goes through the network b/w pods
* kube-proxy is the one that updates ip tables for the pods and containers

== Replication controller

* Deals with scaling
* `kind: ReplicationController`
* used to make sure a certain number of pods are running all the time
* can be used to keep one pod running even after rebootgg
* replication sets can be used to target a particular set of pods for replication (advanced than replication controller)

====
* sudo kubectl create -f helloworld-repl-controller.yml
* sudo kubectl scale --replicas=4 replicationcontroller/helloworld-controller
====

== Deployments
* kind: Deployment
* can do rollout deployments
* useful for stateless apps

.deployment commands
====
* kubectl create -f deployment/filename
* kubectl get deployments
* kubectl get rs
* kubectl rollout status
* kubectl expose deployment
* kubectl set image <new image name>
* sudo kubectl set image helloworld-deployment k8s-demo=wardviaene/k8s-demo:2
* sudo kubectl get pods
* sudo kubectl rollout history deployment/helloworld-deployment
* sudo kubectl rollout undo deployment/helloworld-deployment
====

== Services
* kubectl expose creates a service automatically
* service can also be created manually
* Pods are dynamic and should not be accessed directly but through service

== Labels
* are like tags
* key: value
* not unique
* can use filters to narrow down - these are called node selectors
* kubectl label nodes

== Healthchecks
* running a command on a container
* periodic checks on URL (http)
* livelinessProbe setting on
* success and failure and timeouts can be defined
* edit a deployment to change health check settings

== Rediness Probe
* readinessProbe - a little different from liveness probe
* will wait for the readiness probe to succeed before serving the requests

== Pod state
* check pod lifecycle

== Pod lifecycle
* init container
* post start hook
* readiness / liveliness probe
* pre stop hook

== Secrets
* Distribute credentials, keys and passwords to the pods
* native to kubernetes
* can use external vault service to bypass kubernetes
* secrets as env variables
* as files in volumes
* dotenv files
* can also use external image to pull secrets

* kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass --from-file=<f1> --from-file=<f2>
* secrets can also be ssh keys and ssl certs
* kind secret
* add env variables

* mount volumes and then share secrets as files

== Web UI
* overview of running apps on your cluster
* creating and modifying your cluster
* retrieve state of resources
* https://kubernetes master /ui
* manually install it with kubernetes-dashboard.yaml from k8s git repo
* kubectl config view
* minikube dashboard
* minikube dashboard --url

*****

= Advanced Topics

== Service Discovery using DNS
* addons are in /etc/kubernetes/addons
* using the name of the service should provide a way for service discovery

== ConfigMap
* to use any key / value pairs , env vars or files other than secrets

== Ingress controller
* use a load balancer like nginx with rules defined for forwarding to the correct pod/container
* alternative for loadbalancer and nodeports
* provides public access to the clusters
* kind: Ingress


== External DNS
* creating records in AWS for the dns
* instead of manually creating records kubernetes will create the dns records for us.

== Volumes
* store data outside container
* data within container is lost when container stops
* volumes can be attached using volume plugins
* Create a volume first
* specify volumeMounts

== Autoprovisioned volumes
* kind: StorageClass
* create a volume and then mount it on the pod that you want

== Pod presets
* to inject information into pods during run time
* kind: PodPreset
* to add env variables / files / config etc.,

== Stateful sets
* need a stable pod hostname
* sticky identity using index like podname-0 podname-1, etc., (upto n-1)
* without stateful sets the pods are dynamic names

== Daemon sets
* pods will not be rescheduled
* like logging, monitoring, lbs, reverse proxies, api gateways


== Resource usage monitoring
* heapster
* requisite to do pod autoscaling
* heapster is depricated , use metrics server
* third party tool like prometheus
* kubectl top node / pod

== Autoscaling
* automatically scale pods using metrics
* cluster has to be started with ENABLE_CUSTOM_METRICS
* kind: HorizontalAutoScaling - hpa

== Affinity / Anti affinity
* similar to node selector but has rules for scheduling pods using preferred rules
* can supply a weighting
* can use prepopulated labels

== Interpod affinity / anti affinity
* similar to node affinity and anti affinity

== Taints and Tolerations
* Taints are applied to nodes and tolerations are applied to pods
* kubectl taint node node1 key=value
* tolerations are used like antiaffinity
* tolerations: NoSchedule
* kubectl taint node node1 key- => remove a taint

== Custom resource definition
* api for collection of resources

== Operators
* like modules in puppet

****
== Administration Master services

== Resource quotas
* kind: ResourceQuota

== Namespace
* default: default
* resources should be unique in a namespace

== Users
* normal user
* service user
* Authentication strategies for normal users
** Client certificates
** Bearer Tokens
** Authentication Proxy
** HTTP Basic Authentication
** OpenID
** Webhooks
* Service Accounts
** credentials using namespace
* ABAC (authorization based ), RBAC (role based)
*
